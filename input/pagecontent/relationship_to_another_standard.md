Starting in the May 2018 ballot cycle, HL7 has developed this FHIR Implementation Guide in parallel with the existing CDA Implementation Guide. This new standard includes all new forms as they are added to the HAI work. We anticipate several STU releases on the path to a Normative Release 1 of the HL7 Implmentation Guide for FHIR: Healthcare Associated Infection Reports. The FHIR and CDA implementation guides will align. A change to one standard will require the same change in the other standard. In this release, the new forms included in both the CDA and FHIR standards are:
* Outpatient Procedure Component Denominator for Same Day Outcome Measures Report
* Outpatient Procedure Component Denominator for Procedure Report
* Late Onset Sepsis/Meningitis Denominator (LOS/Men Denom) Report
* Outpatient Procedure Component Same Day Outcome Measures Event Report
* Outpatient Procedure Surgical Site Infection (SSI) Event Report
