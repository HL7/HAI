It specifies the generic constraints for all NHSN Healthcare Associated Infection Reports. Further constraints are found in the specialization profiles for single-patient and population summary reports, and in the profiles for specific report types.</p>

 <tr><td><a href="StructureDefinition-hai-single-person-generic-constraints.html">HAI Single-Person Report Generic Constraints</a> </td><td><p>This profile records the constraints for HAI single-person reports. It is used by all numerator reports covered by this guide. It is also used by the Procedure Denominator Report.</p>
<p>A single-person report must conform to the Healthcare Associated Infection Report profile. In addition, key data about the patient are recorded in the HAI Patient profile referenced in the subject.</p>
<p>The report-specific requirements specify the encounter data to record for each single-person report type. These data always include an identifier for the reporting facility, and usually include the encounter type (inpatient or outpatient), the admission date or encounter date, and the facility unit identifier and type.</p>

Preferred document title:  Surgical Site Infection Report (SSI).
Key encounter data:
The encounter type (inpatient or outpatient) is required.
A value for admission date is required.
A discharge date may be recorded.
The facility id is required.
Other dates and locations:
The date of the infection is recorded as effectiveTime in the Infection-Type Observation.
Other notes: The procedure id is recorded in the Procedure Details Clinical Statement in an Infection-Type Report. NHSN uses this to establish a link between Procedure and SSI Reports.</p>
