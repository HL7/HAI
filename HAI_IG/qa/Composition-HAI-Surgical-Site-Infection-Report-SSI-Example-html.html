            <p>Surgical Site Infection Report (SSI)</p>
            <p>Managed by Community Health and Hospitals</p>
            <p>This section records the infection type, with details. It records whether the infection was present 
                at the time of surgery and whether the SSI was identified through the use of discharge diagnosis 
                or procedure codes. If the patient died, NHSN protocol requires that the death be recorded.</p>
