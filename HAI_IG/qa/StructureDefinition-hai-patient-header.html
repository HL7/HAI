<p>This profile is based on the US Core Patient Profile and defines HAI specific patient constraints:
A patient identifier representing the facility-assigned patient ID is required. Other identifiers for the person can also be present, such as a United States Social Security Number (id/@root = 2.16.840.1.113883.4.1), a Medicare beneficiary identifier (id/@root = 2.16.840.1.113883.4.338), or secondary patient IDs (id/@root = the appropriate facility OID for patient IDs).
The patient name is optional; consult the NHSN reporting protocol and requirements. <em>TODO</em>* - this is required for US Core Patient
Patient gender and birthdate are required.</p>
