            <p>HAI Single-Person Report Generic</p>
            <p>Managed by Community Health and Hospitals</p>
            <p>This profile records the constraints for HAI single-person reports. It is used by all numerator reports covered by this guide.  It is also used by the Procedure Denominator Report.
                A single-person report must conform to the Healthcare Associated Infection Report profile. In addition, key data about the patient are recorded in the HAI Patient profile referenced
                in the subject. The report-specific requirements specify the encounter data to record for each single-person report type. These data always include an identifier for the reporting 
                facility, and usually include the encounter type (inpatient or outpatient), the admission date or encounter date, and the facility unit identifier and type. </p>
