A patient identifier representing the facility-assigned patient ID is required. Other identifiers for the person can also be present, such as a United States Social Security Number (id/@root = 2.16.840.1.113883.4.1), a Medicare beneficiary identifier (id/@root = 2.16.840.1.113883.4.338), or secondary patient IDs (id/@root = the appropriate facility OID for patient IDs).
The patient name is optional; consult the NHSN reporting protocol and requirements. <em>TODO</em>* - this is required for US Core Patient
Patient gender and birthdate are required.</p>

It is used by all numerator reports covered by this guide. It is also used by the Procedure Denominator Report.</p>
<p>A single-person report must conform to the Healthcare Associated Infection Report profile. In addition, key data about the patient are recorded in the HAI Patient profile referenced in the subject.</p>
<p>The report-specific requirements specify the encounter data to record for each single-person report type. These data always include an identifier for the reporting facility, and usually include the encounter type (inpatient or outpatient), the admission date or encounter date, and the facility unit identifier and type.</p>

Key encounter data:
The encounter type (inpatient or outpatient) is required.
A value for admission date is required.
A discharge date may be recorded.
The facility id is required.
Other dates and locations:
The date of the infection is recorded as effectiveTime in the Infection-Type Observation.
Other notes: The procedure id is recorded in the Procedure Details Clinical Statement in an Infection-Type Report. NHSN uses this to establish a link between Procedure and SSI Reports.</p>

<p>Each Pathogen Identified profile represents a set of information concerning a single pathogen identified. The profile contains two component elements that record the pathogen and its rank in regard to the other pathogens identified, and can contain additional component elements recording drug-susceptibility test findings. For pathogen antibiogram reporting requirements, refer to the NHSN protocol and the Information Data Model (IDM).</p>
