<p>This profile either represents a pathogen identified or, using a code from the NHSN Pathogens Code value set, records that no pathogens were identified.</p>
<p>The value set table provides codes for several unspecified speciesfor example &quot;Acidaminococcus species&quot; (SNOMED CT 131202007, NHSN ACISP)for use when a more precise code is not available. The code for an unspecified species is preferred to a genus-level code.</p>
<p>Each Pathogen Identified profile represents a set of information concerning a single pathogen identified. The profile contains two component elements that record the pathogen and its rank in regard to the other pathogens identified, and can contain additional component elements recording drug-susceptibility test findings. For pathogen antibiogram reporting requirements, refer to the NHSN protocol and the Information Data Model (IDM).</p>
