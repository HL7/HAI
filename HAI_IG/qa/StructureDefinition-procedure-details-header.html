<p>This profile records the detail required in a Procedure Report about a procedure.</p>
<p>NHSN uses the procedure id, along with other data, to establish a link between a Procedure Report and an SSI Report; the value of the procedure id must be the same in both the report of a procedure and the report of a surgical-site infection resulting from that procedure. In this profile, the priority code represents the main or primary procedure for the patient in the context of this report.</p>

This profile builds on <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core//StructureDefinition-us-core-procedure.html">US  Core Procedure Profile</a>.</p>
