          This project developed an implementation guide constraining CDA Release 2. The implementation guide supports electronic submission of HAI data to the National Healthcare Safety Network. CDC provided NHSN developers, vocabulary experts and CDA experts to support this project. SDWG reviewed the design and draft specification before ballot.

            >C-CDA</a> is one of the most widely implemented implementation guides for CDA and covers a significant scope of clinical care. Its target of the 'common/essential' elements of healthcare is closely aligned with FHIR's focus on the '80%'. There is significant interest in industry and government in the ability to interoperate between CDA and FHIR and C-CDA is a logical starting point. Implementers and regulators have both expressed an interest in the ability to map between FHIR and C-CDA.
