The report-specific requirements specify the encounter data to record for each single-person report type.

Each Pathogen Identified profile represents a set of information concerning a single pathogen identified. The profile contains two component elements that record the pathogen and its rank in regard to the other pathogens identified, and can contain additional component elements recording drug-susceptibility test findings. For pathogen antibiogram reporting requirements, refer to the NHSN protocol and the Information Data Model (IDM).</td>
